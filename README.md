This repository accompanies the manuscript __Unlocking the Potential of Marine Natural Product Fragments for Rational Anticancer Drug Design: A Computational Approach__

## Overview
This repo contains all computational workflows, data, and scripts used for fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) leveraging marine natural product (MNP) fragments. The study focuses on identifying and analyzing fragment diversity, promiscuity, and synthetic feasibility in the context of multi-target anticancer therapy.
